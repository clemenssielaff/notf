mandatory get_* methods
  CONTRA:
    1. enforcing a get_* before every getter is exposing the internals in the interface
    2. it is ugly
  PRO:
    1. it is clear what the method is: it should take no parameters, should be const, should return a single value
    2. resolves ambiguity with english words that could be a noun (in which case, they would be a getter) or a verb (a modifier)
    ->1. not true, because a getter might also calculate the value, it doesn't have to be a direct field access
